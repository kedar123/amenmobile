## Description

Amen mobile is the mobile application

## Installation

Download this application and attache this with iphone

## Usage
this is used to call the api at backend like 

    $.sammy(function() {
      
      this.get('#/', function() {
        $('#main').text('Welcome!');
      });
      
    });

Inside the 'app' function() `this` is the Application. This is where you can configure the application and add routes.

Above, we defined a `get()` route. When the browser is pointed to `#/` the function passed to that route will be run. Inside the route function, `this` is a Sammy.EventContext. EventContext has a bunch of special methods and properties including a params hash, the ability to redirect, render partials, and more.

Once you've defined an application the only thing left to do is run it. The best-practice behavior is to encapsulate `run()` in a document.ready block:

    var app = $.sammy(...)
    
    $(function() {
      app.run();
    });

This will guarantee that the DOM is loaded before we try to apply functionality to it.
